Hotel Room booking simpleApplication

The whole implementation took me around 2hrs. I tried to use Lock and Monitor to prevent any concurrency issues, but think need some more time. 
Implemented unit tests at ServiceLevel
###### Given more time: 
a. I would have implemented multithreading with lock 
b. Write more unit tests at IBookManager level 
c. Restructure Persistence project a bit by splitting them into two - Persistence and Domain
d. No appSettings.json file added, seeing this simple app I haven't spent much time in further adding json file that will contain connection string.
